A basic implementation of the [ID3 algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_algorithm) to generate a decision tree and display the result in a pretty interactive tree graph.

## Description

The project contains a couple of different test datasets that can be accessed from the main page. Once loaded, the selected dataset will be used to generate a decision tree using the ID3 algorithm. Results are available in the form of a tree graph, where the user can zoom in/out, collapse nodes and view the generated layout of the features and their values in the decision tree.
